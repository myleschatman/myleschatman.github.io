Close to the end of the year of 2016, I read an article on Medium about
motivating aspiring developers to code at least one hour a day for one-hundred
days. Prior to reading this [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.bmwuz5hfq)
, I have spent countless hours in front of my laptop building projects to
enhance my portfolio. Initially I thought this was such a great idea for
beginner or experienced developers to join but I decided to not join the
community.

Just today, I saw a new [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.hqru7hfl9) from the same author with an update to the previous link.

Reading about this challenge a second time definitely changed how I felt about
this challenge. Here are of some of the benefits that I began to realize:

* Joining a community of fellow developers that share the same goals.
* A community on Gitter where questions are welcomed.
* Sharing my process and thoughts on the projects I am currently working on.
* Documenting my progress each day.
* Staying on track by committing to a schedule on a daily basis.

Into the new year, I am very excited to start this challenge and am
glad that I changed my mind.

For anyone that is looking to get started with this challenge, here is a [link](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code)
to the github repository with instructions and rules. Although, many people are
getting started tomorrow Jan. 3, this challenge is an ongoing process and
anyone can join at any time.
