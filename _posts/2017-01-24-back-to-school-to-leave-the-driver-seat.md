It is to no surprise that Self Driving cars exist and the idea of
having access to these driverless vehicles to transport the public around is
definitely in the near future.
Prior to joining the project on a full time basis, learning programming
had already been already been something I was doing but working full time and
attending classes on campus wasn't possible due to schedule conflicts. This was
a time before I even knew Bootcamps had exist which was something I learned
about a year later. I put my dreams of learning how to code on hold and
focused on getting through training at my job. The training was already a
rigorous process having to study and get up to speed with the technology.
Four months later upon finishing training, I was a full fledged Vehicle
Operator and the team felt confident in my ability to hit the road without
supervision.
A typical day consisted of taking the vehicle on the road and manually testing
the software to document any discrepancies the occurred. There were moments when
a critical error occurred which required escalating to an engineer.
So there we have at, awesome company, awesome job, great people to work with,
and much more. So what else could I want at this point in my career.
